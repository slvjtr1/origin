/* The background trailer's decisions: after 5 s without a key on Home, Discover or the Library with a card
   focused, the focused title's trailer (low quality, sound on) plays behind the art; any key stops it at
   once. This module decides when to start and stop; the boards draw it and the player's video backend
   plays it (one hardware decoder: bgt_release_now() before the player loads anything). */
